# Phd site

This repository holds the source code for an academic (PhD) website for Yfke Dulek, 
currently hosted on heroku at www.yfkedulek.com

Site is built using NodeJS / Express, combined with ejs for the views and mongoDB hosted by mlab.
Front-end js and html is my own work. CSS is built around the Skeleton CSS library: http://getskeleton.com/
